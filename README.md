The HackBook: A Comprehensive Cybersecurity Compendium

📌 Overview

The HackBook is an extensive, systematically structured cybersecurity resource designed to bridge the gap between foundational knowledge and advanced cybersecurity methodologies. Synthesized from the CompTIA Security+ SY0-701 Examination Curriculum (as of December 2024) and the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, this compendium provides an academically rigorous yet practically applicable approach to contemporary information security paradigms.

🔹 Relevance and Rationale

The Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate is an industry-recognized program that offers hands-on experience in security fundamentals, incident response, and digital forensics. This guide aligns with its framework while integrating deeper theoretical constructs from the Security+ certification.
